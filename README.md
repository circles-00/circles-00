## About me

I like building cool stuff all the time. I'm usually working on new side-projects as soon as a new idea comes to my mind. I'm always looking for new challenges and I'm always trying to improve my skills.

And, also, the most important thing, I use Vim btw.
And, also, the second most important thing, I use Arch btw.
