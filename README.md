## About me
I'm a software engineer with a passion for learning and teaching. I'm currently working at Banzae as a Senior Software Engineer. I'm also studying Computer Science at Faculty of Computer Science and Engineering in Skopje, Macedonia. I'm passionate about technology and I'm always looking for new things to learn and improve my skills.

I like building cool stuff all the time. I'm usually working on new side-projects as soon as a new idea comes to my mind. I'm always looking for new challenges and I'm always trying to improve my skills.
Currently working as a full-stack developer, but I'm always looking for new things to learn and improve my skills.

And, also, the most important thing, I use Vim btw.
